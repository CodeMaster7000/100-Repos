# 100-Repos
With help from all of you guys, we have finally reached #100 repositories! I can not emphasise enough how this would have been impossible without all of your support. So to everyone part of the Github community, thank you!
# âœ¨ Special Thanks 
I would like to give a special thanks to [SmashedFrenzy16](https://github.com/SmashedFrenzy16) for helping me on this journey. He was the one who gave me the idea of starting this wonderful open-source Github page, and he continues to help me in the forms of collaborations and ideas. If it hadn't been for him, I would not have even begun to realise the potential of providing open-source code to the community. So to conclude this brief message, a special thanks to SmashedFrenzy16, and a huge thanks to everyone part of the Github community!
